TITLES

Course Title: Inference for models of wildlife population dynamics
Athena Title: INFERENCE POP DYNAMICS

COURSE DESCRIPTION

Recently developed statistical tools make it possible to fit models of population dynamics to field data while accounting for observation error. This course will explain how to use these tools for statistical inference and prediction about animal population parameters including abundance, occupancy, survival, recruitment, and dispersal.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE SYLLABUS

COURSE OBJECTIVES OR EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES

1. To provide a practical but rigorous background in

statistical estimation methods.

 

2. To provide a working knowledge of the major methods used to

estimate parameters and test hypotheses about fish and wildlife

populations.

 

Lectures will consider the background and theory of particular

methods in order to provide appreciation for appropriate

experimental designs and analytical methods and to clarify

necessary assumptions. The development of modeling, analytical,

and basic programming skills, as well as the analysis of field

data using microcomputers, will be emphasized in the

laboratories. Students should then be able to apply these

methods to actual situations involving their own field research

or problems common in fisheries and wildlife and conservation

biology. Students will be required to develop and present a

project that applies one or more major estimation methods to a

real data problem using data from their research or other

sources.
