## Overview

#### Central Questions

- What causes spatial and temporal variation in population size and structure?

- How do environmental change and human activities (including management actions) affect population dynamics?

--

#### Approach

1. Develop hypotheses and predictions, then formalize them as statistical models

2. Design study, collect data, and confront models with data

3. Make management decisions based on relative support for hypotheses (and constraints)

4. Monitor population responses to management actions

5. Compare management outcomes to forecasts and update support for hypotheses

6. Repeat steps 3-5
