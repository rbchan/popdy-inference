## Overview

Everyone should be familiar with the following models, but we will review them in some detail:

- Exponential and geometric growth

- Logistic growth

- Stage-structured (matrix) models

- Stochastic versions of the above


For every model, you should know the equations and you should know how to implement it in `R`.


---

## Stage structured models

$${\bf n}(t+1) = {\bf A}{\bf n}(t)$$

where $A$ is the projection matrix and $n$ is the vector of stage-specific abundances

--

Example with 3 stages (juveniles, subadults, and adults)


---

## Stage-structured models in `R`

```{r stage-ex}
f1 <- 0.0   ## Juvenile fecundity
f2 <- 0.5   ## Subadult fecundity
f3 <- 1.5   ## Adult fecundity
s1 <- 0.3   ## Juvenile survival
s2 <- 0.5   ## Subadult survival
s3 <- 0.8   ## Adult survival
A <- matrix(c(f1, f2, f3,
              s1,  0,  0,
               0, s2, s3), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
A
```

-- 

Why do we structure the projection matrix this way?

--

The answer is that it allows us to do convenient operations (e.g., eigenanalysis and matrix multiplication) on the computer.

## Matrix multiplication


---

## Eigenanalysis

---

## Asymptotic growth rate

The dominant eigenvalue is the asymptotic growth rate ($\lambda$)

If $\lambda<1$, the population is expected to decline

```{r lambda}
eA <- eigen(A)
lambda <- Re(eA$values[1])
lambda ## Asymtotic growth rate
```

---

## Net reproductive rate

The expected number of female offspring produced by an individual over the course of its lifetime is called the net reproductive rate $R_0$. As with $\lambda$, the population is expected to increase if $R_0>1$.



---
## Stable stage distribution

The stable stage distribution describes the proportion of individuals that are expected to occur in each stage

```{r ss}
w0 <- Re(eA$vectors[,1])
w <- w0/sum(w0)
w  
```

---

## Reproductive value

Reproductive value describes the relative contribution of each stage class to future generations.
