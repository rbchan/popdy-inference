# Notes for the future

## For 2025

- Might need 3 days for presentations if class size is large

- Add lecture on multi-state CMR?

- Create tree conceptual diagram to organize all the models

- Email profs with syllabi and recommendations

- Make homework due by Monday night instead of Monday morning

- Review previous week's homework in class on Tuesdays

- Add a Bayesian review lecture somewhere in the middle

- Include analysis grade as part of project/paper grade

- R quiz to weed out students on day 1

- Replace 'x1' 'x2' and 'w' with real variable names in occupancyII lecture

- Remove missing values in grouse data, especially for Nmix examples
  * Too much for students to learn so many things at once

- Leave as much time as possible for homework on Thursdays

- Remember the American Oystercatcher data (on GDrive)

- Add lecture on movement models


## For 2024

- Tell professors not to send their students until they're good with R

- Shorten slides and make time for homework on Thursdays

- Nmix-bin II is too long

- Remove missing values in grouse data, especially for Nmix examples
  * Too much for students to learn so many things at once

- Start linear model section with alt form:
  * mu = b0+b1*x, y~N(mu,sig2)
  * Easier transition to GLMs than b0+b1*x+eps

- Add spider plot to SCR shiny app

- Consider moving advanced material (like SCR II) to the end after getting through survival and open models, especially if not many students are using SCR

- Add something about Huggins

- Make 3 days of presentations if necessary

- Include analysis grade as part of project/paper grade



## For 2023

- Ditch binomial N-mix II?

- Avoid generic variable names like 'x', 'y', and 'w'





## For 2022

- Ditch the dynamic N-mixture models? Not enough time?

- Add more real datasets
  * Blandings turtle CJS

- Too many 'versions' for SCR IPP lecture

- Project
  * Require R script with basic analysis for first draft
  * Improve rubric
    + Video presentations instead of in-class

- Show more space-time maps in dynamic lectures

- bs() splines in unmarked


## For 2021

- Cut out popdy-basics intro??? To make more room for dynamic models?

- Introduce JAGS in "stats-intro" lecture

- Project
  * Require R script with basic analysis for first draft
  * Improve rubric

- For first SCR lecture, show 1D and 2D encounter rate function

- Add info on parametric survival models and Cox PH

- Show more space-time maps in dynamic lectures

- bs() splines in unmarked
