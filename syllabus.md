## Grades


All academic work must meet the standards contained in the University's [academic honesty policy](https://honesty.uga.edu/).  All students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work.  The [penalties for academic dishonesty](https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Consequences_for_Honesty_Violations/) are severe, and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.
