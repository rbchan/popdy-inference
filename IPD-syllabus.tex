\section*{\normalsize Course Description}
\vspace{-4mm}
Recently developed statistical tools make it possible to fit models of
population dynamics to field data while accounting for observation
error. This course will explain how to use these tools for statistical
inference and prediction about animal population parameters including
abundance, occupancy, survival, recruitment, and dispersal.   


\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-4mm}
By the end of the course, students will know how to (1) design studies
of wildlife population dynamics, (2) fit statistical
models to data collected in the field, (3) interpret results, and (4)
make predictions useful for informing conservation decisions.

\section*{\normalsize Attendance}
%\vspace{-4mm}
Attendance is optional, but it will be difficult to succeed if you don't participate in lectures. 



%\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Academic Honesty}
%\vspace{-4mm}
As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the
UGA academic honesty policy. UGA Student Honor code: ``I will be
academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate
academic dishonesty of others''. A Culture of Honesty, the University's
policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can
be found at \href{https://honesty.uga.edu/}{here}. You are responsible for
informing yourself about the universityâ€™s standards before performing
any academic work. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is
not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Please ask if you have
questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty
policy. Any form of possible academic dishonesty will be reported to
the UGA Office of the Vice President for Instruction.



%\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Generative AI}
%\vspace{-4mm}

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like chatGPT and other generative AI
chatbots, can be useful for improving text and computer code. However,
they can also hinder learning if used to generate answers and bypass
critical thinking. Students must disclose the use of generative AI for
completing assignments, including the final paper. If a
student decides to use generative AI, it can only be used to improve
text and code written by the student. AI tools cannot be used to create
answers by inputting assignment questions into prompts. Students
must report the prompts provided to AI tools, along with the original
text (or code) and the final text. Prompts and output can be disclosed
by copying and pasting screenshots into assignment documents.

Assistance with time management, test and performance anxiety,
notetaking, motivation, text comprehension, test preparation, and
other barriers to success at

\section*{\normalsize Accommodations for Disabilities}
%\vspace{-4mm}

If you require a disability-required accommodation, it is essential
that you register with the \href{https://drc.uga.edu}{Disability Resource Center} (Clark Howell
Hall; 706-542-8719)
and notify me of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. We
can then plan how best to coordinate your accommodations. Please note
that accommodations cannot be provided retroactively.

\section*{\normalsize UGA Well-Being Resources}
%\vspace{-4mm}

UGA Well-being Resources promote student success by cultivating a
culture that supports a more active, healthy, and engaged student
community. Anyone needing assistance is encouraged to contact Student Care \&
Outreach (SCO) in the Division of Student Affairs at 706-542-8479 or
visit \url{sco.uga.edu}. Student Care \& Outreach helps students
navigate difficult circumstances by connecting them with the most
appropriate resources or services. They also administer the Embark@UGA
program which supports students experiencing, or who have experienced,
homelessness, foster care, or housing insecurity. 

UGA provides both clinical and non-clinical options to support student
well-being and mental health, any time, any place. Whether on campus,
or studying from home or abroad, UGA Well-being Resources are here to
help.
