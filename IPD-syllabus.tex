\section*{\normalsize Course Description}
\vspace{-4mm}
Classical courses on population dynamics focus on theoretical models 
of how populations should behave under a set of assumptions.
Evaluating how actual populations behave requires confronting models
with data. Recently developed statistical tools make it possible to fit
models of population dynamics to field data while accounting for
observation error. This course will explain how to use these tools for
statistical inference and prediction.  


\vspace{-4mm}
\section*{\normalsize Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-4mm}
By the end of the course, students will know how to (1) design studies
of wildlife population dynamics, (2) fit statistical
models to data collected in the field, (3) interpret results, and (4)
make predictions useful for informing conservation decisions.

Attendance is optional, but it will be impossible to succeed in the
class if you don't participate in lectures. 

% \vspace{-2mm}
% \section*{\normalsize COVID-19}
% \vspace{-4mm}
% Per USG guidelines, students and instructors are required to wear a
% face mask while inside instructional buildings. Face covering use is
% in addition to, and is not a substitute for, appropriate
% distancing. Anyone not wearing a face covering when required will be
% asked to wear one or must leave the area. Repeated refusal to comply
% with the requirement may result in discipline through the applicable
% conduct code for faculty, staff or students.

% Reasonable accommodations may be made (through DRC) for those who are
% unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. 

% Prior to Thanksgiving Break, lectures and labs will be delivered
% in-person, and they will be recorded and posted online. After
% Thanksgiving Break, all lectures and labs will be delivered online. 

% Online (remote) learning will involve both synchronous and
% asynchronous activities.

%{\it DawgCheck}

% Please perform a quick symptom check each weekday on DawgCheck—on the
% UGA app or website—whether you feel sick or not. It will help health
% providers monitor the health situation on campus:
% \url{https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/}

%{\it What do I do if I have symptoms?}

% Students showing symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an
% appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162
% (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies
% and after-hours care, see

\section*{\normalsize Academic Honesty}
\vspace{-4mm}
As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the
UGA academic honesty policy. UGA Student Honor code: “I will be
academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate
academic dishonesty of others”. A Culture of Honesty, the University's
policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can
be found at \url{https://honesty.uga.edu/}. You are responsible for
informing yourself about the university’s standards before performing
any academic work. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is
not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Please ask if you have
questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty
policy. Any form of possible academic dishonesty will be reported to
the UGA Office of the Vice President for Instruction.
