\section*{\normalsize Course Description}
\vspace{-4mm}
Recently developed statistical tools make it possible to fit models of
population dynamics to field data while accounting for observation
error. This course will explain how to use these tools for statistical
inference and prediction about animal population parameters including
abundance, occupancy, survival, recruitment, and dispersal.   


\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-4mm}
By the end of the course, students will know how to (1) design studies
of wildlife population dynamics, (2) fit statistical
models to data collected in the field, (3) interpret results, and (4)
make predictions useful for informing conservation decisions.

\section*{\normalsize Academic Honesty}
\vspace{-4mm}
As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the
UGA academic honesty policy. UGA Student Honor code: ``I will be
academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate
academic dishonesty of others''. A Culture of Honesty, the University's
policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can
be found at \href{https://honesty.uga.edu/}{here}. You are responsible for
informing yourself about the university’s standards before performing
any academic work. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is
not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Please ask if you have
questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty
policy. Any form of possible academic dishonesty will be reported to
the UGA Office of the Vice President for Instruction.

\section*{\normalsize Accommodations for Disabilities}
\vspace{-4mm}

If you require a disability-required accommodation, it is essential
that you register with the \href{https://drc.uga.edu}{Disability Resource Center} (Clark Howell
Hall; 706-542-8719)
and notify me of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. We
can then plan how best to coordinate your accommodations. Please note
that accommodations cannot be provided retroactively.

% \section*{\normalsize Diversity and Inclusion}
% \vspace{-4mm}
% The phrase ‘diversity and inclusion’ encompasses welcoming and respect
% for differences of culture, background and experience among
% individuals and groups. Such differences include, but are not limited
% to, differences of race, ethnicity, national origin, color, gender,
% sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and abilities, as well as
% political and religious affiliation and socioeconomic status. As UGA
% grows more diverse, creating a welcoming climate of respect and
% inclusiveness for all is more important than ever. 

\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Generative AI}
\vspace{-4mm}

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like chatGPT and other generative AI
chatbots, can be useful for improving text and computer code. However,
they can also hinder learning if used to generate answers and bypass
critical thinking. Students must disclose the use of generative AI for
completing assignments, including labs and the final paper. If a
student decides to use generative AI, it can only be used to improve
text and code written by the student. AI tools cannot be used to create
answers by inputting assignment questions into prompts. Students
must report the prompts provided to AI tools, along with the original
text (or code) and the final text. Prompts and output can be disclosed
by copying and pasting screenshots into assignment documents.

% The Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) grants
% students certain information privacy rights. To comply with FERPA, all
% communication that refers to individual students must be through a
% secure medium (UGAMail or eLC) or in person. Instructors are not
% allowed to respond to messages that refer to individual students or

% \section*{\normalsize COVID-19}
% \vspace{-4mm}

% {\it Face coverings \\}
% Following guidance from the University System of Georgia, face
% coverings are recommended for all individuals while inside campus
% facilities. 

% {\it How can I obtain the COVID-19 vaccine? \\}
% University Health Center is scheduling appointments for students
% through the UHC Patient Portal
% (\url{https://patientportal.uhs.uga.edu/login\_dualauthentication.aspx}). Learn
% more here – \url{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-vaccine}. 

% The Georgia Department of Health, pharmacy chains and local providers
% also offer the COVID19 vaccine at no cost to you. To find a COVID-19
% vaccination location near you, please go to:
% \url{https://georgia.gov/covid-vaccine}. 

% In addition, the University System of Georgia has made COVID-19
% vaccines available at 15 campuses statewide and you can locate one
% here: \url{https://www.usg.edu/vaccination}

% {\it What do I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?}
% Students showing COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an
% appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162
% (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies
% and after-hours care, see, \url{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies}.

% {\it What do I do if I test positive for COVID-19?}
% If you test positive for COVID-19 at any time, you are required to
% report it through the DawgCheck Test Reporting Survey. We encourage
% you to stay at home if you become ill or until you have excluded
% COVID-19 as the cause of your symptoms. UGA adheres to current Georgia
% Department of Public Health (DPH) quarantine and isolation guidance
% and requires that it be followed. Follow the instructions provided to
% you when you report your positive test result in DawgCheck.

% {\it Guidelines for COVID-19 Quarantine Period} (As of 8/1/21) \\
% Students who are fully vaccinated do not need to quarantine upon
% exposure unless they have symptoms of COVID-19 themselves. All others
% should follow the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH)
% recommendations: Students who are not fully vaccinated and have been
% directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should
% self-quarantine for 10 days. Those quarantining for 10 days must have
% been symptom-free throughout the monitoring period and continue
% self-monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms for a total of 14 days. You
% should report the need to quarantine on DawgCheck
% (\url{https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/}), and communicate directly with your
% faculty to coordinate your coursework while in quarantine. If you need
% additional help, reach out to Student Care and Outreach (sco@uga.edu)
% for assistance.
